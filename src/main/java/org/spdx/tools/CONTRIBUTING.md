Pull Requests
-------

The source code for `Spdx-Java-Library` is hosted on [github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library). Please review [open pull requests](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library/pulls) and [active branches](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library/branches) before committing time to a substantial revision. Work along similar lines may already be in progress.

To submit a pull request via GitHub, fork the repository, create a topic branch from `master` for your work, and send a pull request when ready. If you would prefer to send a patch or grant access to pull from your own Git repository, please contact the project's contributors by e-mail.

To contribute an implementation of a feature defined by a version of the SPDX specification later than the one supported by the current SPDX Tools release, clone the branch `spec/X.X`, where X.X is the major.minor version of the targeted specification (e.g. "3.0").

Once implemented, submit a pull request with `spec/X.X` branch as the parent branch.
